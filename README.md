**this code will download the files to a file that will be created on your desktop called (all_youtube_downloaded_video) so you will have all the downloaded videos in one directory.

**this is the first version of the code and there is going to be a dramatic imporvments in the upcomming versions for sure.. so it might have a GUI like any other will made application.

**there might be some issues with the (itags) values because they were hard-coded in this version but the next versions will for sure have a much better approach to solve this issue as soon as possible...
